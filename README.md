When three people who rarely meet up together in person buy a *lot* of magic cards, how do you decide who gets which of the rare cards?

If you're a nerd and want to practice your Laravel skills, you build an app!

~~ Warning ~~
This app is written quickly under the premise that no-one except me will be trying to add to it. Within these files you will likely find unoptimised functions, hilarious antipatterns and general bad practice, only some of which I can blame on my AI autocomplete. 

If, after reading this, or after looking through this code, you decide to use it in one of your projects, great! That's why I made it public. But if you're hoping for a setup guide, or even a proper explanation of what it does... then I happily accept PRs ;)
